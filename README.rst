Micropython Library for the HT16K33-based LED Matrices, ported from Adafruit's
Adafruit_CircuitPython_HT16K33 library.

This is a library for using the IÂ²C-based LED matrices with the HT16K33 chip.

It supports Adafruit's 16x8 and 8x8 matrices, as well as 7-Segment Numeric (not
  tested yet) and 14-Segment Alphanumeric displays (tested).

This library does NOT YET handle matrix displays because I do not have any of
  those to test with.

Documentation at http://micropython-ht16k33.readthedocs.io/

NOTE: At this time, only the 14 segment 4 character displays have been tested.
  Others *may* work but have not been tested so be warned.
